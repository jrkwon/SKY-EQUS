GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  
  This header file contains generic RSQ-list processing functions for the 
  RLP software. It is not specific to any one RLP type.

  It is assumed that the user will not directly access any RSQ information
  contained in the RSQ structure.  Instead, all RSQ access can be done
  via the externalized functions or macros provided in this file and the
  dsrlprsq.h file.

  The  resequencing queue is simply a queue of small dsm items.  This takes
  advantage of the embedded q_link_type inside each dsm item.
  
  This module consists of four functions:
 
  dsrlprsq_init() is called once from within dslrp_init() to initialize the
  resequencing queue at the beginning of an RLP session. 
 
  dsrlprsq_reset() is called from within dsrlpi_reset() each time an RLP
  instance resets. It will take any resequencing queue entries with sequence
  numbers up until LV(N) and convey them to upper layers. Any remaining items
  in the queue will be freed.
 
  dsrlprsq_remove() removes as many items as possible from the resequencing
  queue, subject to limitations from the max_chain_cnt parameter and the
  sequence  numbers of items relative to LV(N). So it will keep removing
  until it removes max_chain_cnt chains or finds a dsm item chain with
  sequence number greater than LV(N). 
 
  It is called from within dsrlp_process_rx_frames(),
  dsrlpi_process_rexmit_frame(), dsrlprsq_reset(), and dsrlprsq_insert(). 
  Users may optimize the value of maximum chains to remove with
  DSRLPI_MAX_CHAINS_TO_REMOVE or set it to zero which means the only
  restriction to removing items from the resequencing queue is their sequence
  number relative to LV(N). 
  
  dsrlprsq_insert() is the function that inserts out-of-sequence frames into
  the resequencing queue. Inserts are made according to the sequence numbers
  of the items to be inserted as long as the sequence numbers are equal or
  greater to LV(N). Whenever possible this function will attempt to append to
  an existing dsm item chain in the resequencing queue instead of inserting a
  new dsm item in order to minimize the size of the queue. For an append to
  happen though, the sequence numbers need to be sequential. This function
  also makes sure that there is no repetition and it can discard an incoming
  frame if it is already in the queue and also replace an existing dsm item
  chain or even a combination of dsm item chains if they can be replaced by a
  new incoming frame.

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
  -- RLP configuration and initialization procedures.

  each separate rlp session.

FUNCTION       DSRLPRSQ_RESET

DESCRIPTION    Insert this new entry into the ReSeq Queue. Inserted based on

FUNCTION       DSRLPRSQ_REMOVE

DESCRIPTION    Removes as many Resesquencing Q entries as possible and 
               places then in the rx watermark structure. It is limited
			   by max_chain_cnt. It will not check for data continuity
			   from dsm item chain to dsm item chain in the Q but it will
			   make sure that the first sequence number of a dsm item chain
			   is less than LV(N) (start of the first hole) before removing
			   fro the Q.

PARAMETERS     rscb_ptr : pointer to the session control block.

               max_chain_cnt: max number of dsm item chains to be removed at
			   once. Time sensitive applications need to use a smaller 
               number for this, as dsm_enqueue() operations into the rx 
               watermark structure take some time to complete. If called 
               with ZERO then no limit is imposed.

DEPENDENCIES   Input ptrs are non-null.
