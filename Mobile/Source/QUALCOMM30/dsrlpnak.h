FUNCTION       DSRLPNAK_INSERT

DESCRIPTION    Insert this new entry into the nak list.  Inserted according
               to sequence number.  Nak entry is filled out with first nak
               round information.
               
               If entry already exists, then nothing is done.
               
               Insert(a,b):  a is the first missing frame, inclusive.
               b is the 32-bit sequence number of the frame just received,
               as calculated by frame determination.  This means that the
               second number is exclusive to the set of missing frames.
               
               Possible insertions are:
               
               Insert            Results in these being inserted
               3  -> 5                3 -> 5
               
               3  -> 3f               3 -> 3f
               
               3  -> 4a               3 -> 4, 4 -> 4a
               
               3a -> 4                3a -> 4
               
               3a -> 4g               3a -> 4, 4 -> 4g

               This maintains the rule that if segmented frames are being
               NAK'd, then an entry contains the NAK info for the bytes

FUNCTION       DSRLPNAK_NAK_WAS_SENT

DESCRIPTION    Tells the nak list if a particular nak was sent over the air.
               Results in decrementing the naks_left counter.  In the case
               where naks_left counter == 0, nothing is done.  The nak_entry
               is "reset" in the Rx Task, in the dsrlpnak_age_list function.
               This scheme prevents any mutual exclusion issues between the
               RX and TX task.

FUNCTION       DSRLPNAK_GET_NAK

DESCRIPTION    Returns an id for the next nak entry which requires a NAK to
               be sent (i.e, age == 0, and naks_left > 0).
               
               The entry is returned as a uint32's.  The TX task is assumed
               to only use functions/macros found in dsrlpnak.c/.h to
               access nak entry info.  As such, it is not important for the
               calling task to know what type the nak_id is.  
               
               Input requires the user to input "curr_nak_id".  If this
               value is zero, then the very first nak entry (requiring
               nak transmission) is returned.  Else, this id refers to a
               nak list entry; in this case the id of nak entry after the
               referenced entry is returned.

DEPENDENCIES   Input ptrs are non-null.
               
               This can only be called by the TX task.  Must not be called

               RX task.  
               
RETURN VALUE   An id for the next nak entry which requires a nak xmission.
               If the return value is zero, then there are no more nak
               entries requiring transmission.

DESCRIPTION    Given an input sequence number (with unknown SEQ_HI), 
               finds the SEQ_HI for that number.
               
               The fr_info_ptr's seq_num is updated with the found seq
               number (if it is found).  The input nak_id is updated with
               a reference point, so that if dsrlpnak_remove is called
               with it, it can be more efficient.
