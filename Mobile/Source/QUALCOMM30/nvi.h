   Each variable in NVM is either fixed, active, or double buffered.

   A fixed variable is not relocated in NVM.  Fixed variables which are
   accessible from external tasks have a pointer, while fixed variables
   which are used internally do not have a pointer to them.

   An active variable is of the form:
   1 byte:  Active flag:
            0 if not active (no valid information stored in the variable),
            NOT 0 if active.
   n bytes: The variable
   An active variable is pointer based and can be relocated in NVM.

FUNCTION NVI_MOVE_HANDOVER

DESCRIPTION
  This function checks for the presence of the RF Handover Block.  If the
  block is found, it reallocates it to a "safe" location to be checked
  again later, after the rebuild.

DEPENCENCIES
  This function should only be called by nva_init immediately after
  detecting that the handover block header is present.

RETURN VALUE
  None.

SIDE EFFECTS
  The handover block (if present) is reallocated into the SMS message
  area.
