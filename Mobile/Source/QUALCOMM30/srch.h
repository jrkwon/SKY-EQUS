/*===========================================================================

FUNCTION SRCH_TASK

DESCRIPTION    This function is the main routine for the Search Task.

      Several main purpose(s) of the Search task are to:

        1.  Initially search for, and find, a CDMA pilot in-channel,

        2.  Measure neighboring cell's pilot energies and call for handoffs,

        3.  Establish and maintain CDMA system time and frequency track,

        4.  Keep multipath RAKE receiver fingers/combiners tracking good pilots,

        5.  Put the MSM chip to sleep and re-establish acquisition after wakeup.

      The Search task's state machine begins in START, and under control by
      Main Control, proceeds generally through the following transitions:
                                    _____________________________
                                   |           /|\               |
                                   |            |                |
                                  \|/           |                | 
           START -> CDMA -> ACQ -> SC -> SL -> PC -> TC -> UN -> +
            /|\                                /|\
             |                                  |
            \|/                                \|/
            DZ                                 ZZ

      Interfacing between Search and other tasks is accomplished by means of
      queues, called interfaces, and REX signals. Types of information passed
      between Search and other tasks include state change commands, reports, 
      data tables to store to and read from NV, search, finger, and AGC/power
      control data packets, and mode information.
      
      Also, Search interacts heavily with the CDMA demodulation hardware.
      This hardware includes a searcher, demodulation fingers, symbol,
      frequency, and power combiners, and AGC reference control circuitry.
      The Search task interfaces with the demodulation hardware by means
      of device drivers and interrupt callback functions.

      The following table summarizes the main interfaces which exist between
      Search and the rest of DMSS:

       Interface       Type of          
         With         Interface             Why Information Exchanged
        ------        ---------             -------------------------
        MC Task       REX queues            MC sending commands to Search
                                            Search sending reports to MC

        CDMA Demod    Device drivers        Search controlling demod hardware
        Hardware                            (searcher, fingers, combiner, AGC)

        Services                            searcher dump, wakeup, keypress)

        DIAG Task     REX queues            Search sending searcher, finger,
                                            AGC, power control data to the DM

        NV Task       Called interfaces     Search storing/retrieving PN mask,
                                            sleep status, freq-temp estimation
                                            table to/from nonvolatile memory

        DB Services   Called interfaces     Search storing/retrieving sleep
                                            status, acquisition mode, RF mode
                                            (PCN -vs- Cellular)

        Sleep Task    Called interfaces     Search programming sleep timer,

                                            waiting on REX signals.

      Upon task creation, the Search task main routine performs initializations
      such as setting up queues, defining timers, and reading parameters from
      NV, then enters an infinite loop which runs the Search main state machine.
