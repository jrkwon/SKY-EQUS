*    Supplemental Channel Processing Routines
*
* GENERAL DESCRIPTION
*   This module contains functions to process SCAM messages
* received from a base station.  It also includes functions to
* process the data pattern testing information.  The SCAM processing is
* currently only for version 0.1 of MDR, and the DPR information is
* usable for versions 0.1 or 0.2 of MDR, and possibly also 1.0.

*
* when       who     what, where, why
* --------   ---     -------------------------------------------------------
* 10/20/99   lcc     Added MSM5000/IS2000 MDR support.
* 07/26/99   jq      Redefined the timer types to a enum structure
* 07/22/99   jq      Added shared data type for SCAM-GHDM linking
* 03/30/99   ram     Updated the header information for the function
                     prototypes to match those in the c file. Externalised
                     mccscm_cancel_prev_dur_timer since it's used by other
                     modules.
* 03/15/99   ram     Updated scam_timer_msg to be of caii_scam_type rather
                     than mccrxtx_msg_type since it's used only for SCAM.
                     fixed incorrect comment about SCAM timer.
* 03/09/99   ram     Externalized SCAM/GHDM duration related functions.
* 02/19/99   ram     Externalized IS95B SCAM processing function and related
                     data. Removed unused data structures, lint cleanup
                     and added more comments to the function prototypes.
* 02/11/99   ram     Added mdr_pre_process to pre-process the MDR related
                     fields of SCAM and GHDM. Created scam_process function
                     to process SCAM message. Featurized code under
                     IS95B_MDR and SPECIAL_MDR.
* 01/19/99   lcc     Moved FEATURE_IS95B_MDR below #includes for header files.
                     Now it builds correctly with and without FEATURE_IS95B_MDR.
* 01/19/99   ram     Added FEATURE_IS95B_MDR defines so that the file
*                    builds correctly when FEATURE_IS95B is turned off.
* 12/23/98   lcc     Corrected definition of mdr_fwd_dpt_frames to take care
                     of RS2 frames also.
* 12/22/98   nmn     improved output
* 12/16/98   nmn     surrounded all DPT code with #defines
* 12/11/98   nmn     Linted for 0.2
* 12/01/98   ram     Added prototypes for MDR DPT related functions
* 11/23/98   nmn     DPT works sucessfully with two channels
* 11/19/98   nmn     add DPT processing using byte length data
* 10/15/98   nmn     added separate functions to perform different parts
*                    of SCAM processing
* 07/13/98   nmn     linted file
* 07/10/98   nmn     removed variables in favor of those in cai.h
* 07/09/98   nmn     created variables, changed spacing
* 07/08/98   nmn     Initial document

FUNCTION MCCSCM_MDR_PRE_PROCESS

DESCRIPTION
  This function pre-processes an MDR supplemental channel message
  (either SCAM or GHDM) and makes sure all the relevant fields are
  within expected range. If not, the message may have to be rejected
  and if so, this function will return the reject code to the calling 
  function.  It also checks if an MDR service option connection
  has been established and the negotiated mux options allow the number
  of supplementals assigned by the message.

DEPENDENCIES                            
  FEATURE_IS95B_MDR or FEATURE_SPECIAL_MDR must be turned on.
  The function should be called before the GHDM action time
  processing and before the SCAM start/stop time processing.

RETURN VALUE
  A value of type mccscm_stat_enum_type to indicate sucess or reason
  of failiure. The reason of failiure may be a reject reason. If so,
  the message has to be rejected.

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.

FUNCTION MCCSCM_SCAM_SUP_PROCESS

DESCRIPTION
  This function processes the supplemental channel info given by SCAM
  message and takes the necessary actions.
  The actions include sending a command to SRCH task to start or stop
  supplemental channels and also updating the local code channel
  list information maintained by CP task if necessary. Duration timer
  is also started if necessary.

  Only Forward traffic channel supplementals are supported.
  
DEPENDENCIES                            
  FEATURE_IS95B_MDR must be turned on, and a MDR call must be in
  progress. The function should be called after the

FUNCTION MCCSCM_SCAM_PROCESS

DESCRIPTION
  This function processes a SCAM message. This includes pre-processing
  and checking for errors, starting a start timer if necessary, or
  processing the supplemental channel info if there is no explicit
  start time provided.
  
  If there is a reason to reject the SCAM message, this
  function will send the reject order with the appropriate reject
  reason.
  
  Only Forward traffic channel supplementals are supported.
  
DEPENDENCIES                            
  FEATURE_IS95B_MDR must be turned on, and a MDR call must be in
  progress. The function should be called before the 
  after the SCAM start/stop time processing, since the pre-processing
  happens before the start time of the message. However, if the
  start time is implicit, we can process the message right away, so
  the function will call the supplemental processing function.

RETURN VALUE
  A value of type mccscm_stat_enum_type indicating success or
  failiure. 

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.

FUNCTION MCCSCM_DURATION_TIMER_CHK

DESCRIPTION
  This function checks the SCAM or GHDM message to see if a duration 
  timer is needed. If so, it starts a timer for the required time. If
  the start timer is already on, it cancels the start timer and
  starts a new start timer based on the given message.

  The start time from the message is the actual system time at 
  which the SCAM processing must start. This function uses the
  current system time and the system time given by the message to
  find out the actual time in milliseconds to wait before processing
  the rest of the message.

DEPENDENCIES                            
  A MDR call must be in progress.

RETURN VALUE
  MDR_DONE_S indicating that the timer is set as needed. No
  other return values are needed here.

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.

FUNCTION MCCSCM_PROCESS_STOP_REQ

DESCRIPTION
  This function process a request to stop processing supplementals.
  The function needs to be invoked when the duration timer expires
  so that the mobile can stop processing supplementals at that time.
  This function may also be invoked at the end of an MDR call if the
  supplementals are active.

  This function sends a SRCH command to stop processing supplementals.
  It will not affect the code channel list maintenance, ie. all the
  supplemental channel walsh codes in the current actice set will be retained.

FUNCTION MCCSCM_CANCEL_PREV_DUR_TIMER

DESCRIPTION
  This function cancels a previously set duration timer and
  the corrosponding signal for a SCAM or GHDM processing message.
  This function needs to be called to clear a duration timer
  set by a previous SCAM or a GHDM message whenever a new SCAM
  or GHDM superseeds the old message's duration time. 
  
DEPENDENCIES                            
  FEATURE_IS95B_MDR or FEATURE_SPECIAL_MDR must be turned on,  
  and a MDR call must be in progress. This function assumes that
  the calling function is either a SCAM or GHDM processing function
  for MDR forward supplementals.

  None.

FUNCTION MCCSCM_SET_DEC_SUP

DESCRIPTION
  This function sends a command to RXC which will program the deinterleaver
  and decoder to decode the number of supplementals requested.  This function
  must be called right after sending the command to searcher to update
  supplementals.  Since the information is already contained in the searcher
  command and this function is always called after, this command will just
  take the srch command as input parameter.

DEPENDENCIES                            
  mcc_srch_buf must contain the just executed SRCH command (this is the case
  since SRCH does not corrupt the command packet).
