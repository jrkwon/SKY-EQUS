When you are going to modify a Qualcomm source code,
You should add the special comment like this

/* id yyyy-mm-dd --> @ WhyWhat */
#ifdef FEATURE_EQUS_IdOfModel
/* the modified version for IdOfModel */
#else
/* the original version of the Qualcomm */
#endif /* FEATURE_EQUS_IdOfModel */
/* <-- */

For example, in case the ID is jrkwon and the model name
is "A10", we can comment like this

/* jrkwon 2000-07-17 --> is not needed any more */
#ifdef FEATURE_EQUS_A10
/* the modified version for IdOfModel */
#else
/* the original version of the Qualcomm */
#endif /* FEATURE_EQUS_A10 */
/* <-- */
