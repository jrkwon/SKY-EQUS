
                       -- The EQUS coding convention --


1. Use spaces instead of a tab
   1 tab = 4 spaces

2. USE CAPITAL LETTERS IN FILE AND PATH NAME
   Do not assume the file system is case sensitive.

3. EQUS file naming convention

   eq<category><_|x>xxxx.c|h
   
   e.g.
   eqa_idle.c    --> idle applet
   eqc_nedt.c    --> dial number edit control 
   eqc_aedt.c    --> alpha/hangul numeric edit control
   eqs_grph.c    --> graphic system in display engine
   eqsqevnt.c    --> q means qualcomm. the converting routine 
                     from qualcomm event to EQUS event

4. EQUS function naming convention

   EQS_         state machine and display engine
   EQA_         applet
   EQA_MainXxxx the top applet of all sub applets in a file
   sEQA_Xxxxx   local applet
   EQC_         control

5. Adding new feature, use FEATURE_SKTT_XXXX format.
   There are so many features in the DMSS software.
   I want to know which features are for SKTT.

6. Never use the path in including header file.
   We can change the directory sturcture at any time.

7. function naming
   <Verb><Object>
   
   e.g.
   UpdateDisplay (0)
   DisplayUpdate (X)
   ClearScreen   (0)
   ScreenClear   (X)   

8. Do not include "eqx_xxxx.h".
   While you're working in a applet, include only one file, "eqa.h".
   Whenever you add a header file in an applet set, you should add 
   the header file at the end of "eqa.h".
   
9. Never use "extern" in C implementation file
   You have to make a header file to declare some functions or 
   variables to "extern"

10. image file name
   <country>_xxxx.ebi
   <country> is three characters.
   ebi = Equs Bitmap Image

   e.g.
   kor_strt.ebi         The startup image for the Korean version   
   usa_strt.ebi         The startup image for the English(USA) version
